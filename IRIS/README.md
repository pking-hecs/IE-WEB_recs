<pre>IRIS Student Dashboard - Static Clone
This project is a static front-end clone of the IRIS student dashboard for NITK Surathkal, built using pure HTML and CSS. It was created as a submission for the IE web team recruitment task.
The project faithfully recreles a complex, multi-paned dashboard layout, demonstrating clean semantic HTML structure and modern CSS for layout, including Flexbox.
Features
●	Multi-part Layout: Features a complex layout with a top-bar, a sticky navigation bar, a dashboard header, and a main content area.
●	Two-Column Design: The main body is split into a "Quick Links" sidebar and a main "Info" panel.
●	Dashboard Widgets: Includes info cards for "Major Credits," "Major CGPA," and "Semester."
●	Mock Content Panels: Contains tabbed sections, message boxes, and an "Upcoming Events" panel to simulate a real, dynamic dashboard.
●	Clean Code: Written with clean, well-named CSS IDs and classes for easy readability and maintenance.
●	Icon Integration: Uses Font Awesome for a polished and professional look.
