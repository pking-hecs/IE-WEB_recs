<pre>Scientific Calculator
This project is a functional scientific calculator built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created as a submission for the [Your College Club Name] web team recruitment task.
The calculator supports standard arithmetic operations as well as scientific functions like logarithms, exponents, percentages, and parentheses.
Features
●	Standard Arithmetic: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
●	Scientific Functions:
○	Logarithm (log) - Base 10
○	Exponentiation (^)
○	Percentage (%)
○	Sign Toggle (+/-)
●	Input Management:
○	Parentheses (( )) for controlling the order of operations.
○	Backspace (<-) to delete the last entered character.
○	All Clear (AC) to reset the calculator.
●	Clean UI: A clean, dark-themed, and responsive interface with clear visual feedback on button presses.
●	Error Handling: Displays "Error" for invalid expressions (e.g., division by zero, syntax errors) to prevent a broken state.
