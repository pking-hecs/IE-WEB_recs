<pre>Web OS - Desktop UI Simulation
This project is a simple simulation of a desktop operating system (OS) environment, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created as a submission for the IE web team
recruitment task.
The project features a functional dock, start menu, draggable windows, and a working light/dark mode theme toggle.
  
Features
●	Desktop Interface: A clean desktop view with a wallpaper and icon dock.
●	Start Menu: A functional start menu that toggles on click, providing access to mock applications.
●	Window Management:
○	Open and close mock "Browser" and "File Explorer" windows.
●	Theme Toggling:
○	A working Day (light) and Night (dark) mode toggle.
○	The UI smoothly transitions between themes.
●	CSS-Only Toggles: Uses hidden checkboxes and labels for all window and menu toggling, requiring no complex JavaScript for state management.
●	Clean & Responsive: Built with clean, well-named variables and a layout that adapts to the viewport.
